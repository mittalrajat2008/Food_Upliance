### Recommendations

* As Spaghetti and Grilled Chicken are most popular, 
so we can give some discount on these 2 dishes 
which will attract more customers/users.
* The locations Austin, Boston and Miami
which are less performing, we should run marketing campaigns
to make awareness and attract more users.
* As numbers of orders for dinner is very high,
food makers and delivery partners shold remain more active
during this time.
* 25-28 age group people orders mostly, so 
more food items which are suitable for this age group 
should be added.
* Emphasis should be given to reduce the delivery time,
to make the experience better.
